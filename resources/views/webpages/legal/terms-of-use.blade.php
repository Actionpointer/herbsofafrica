                                                Agreement, we will do so in addition to the stipulated payments.

                                                subject to Sales Tax in a jurisdiction, and you have not
                                                remitted the required Sales Tax to us, you will be liable for
                                                payment of such Sales Tax, along with any related penalties or
                                                interest, to the relevant tax authority. Furthermore, you agree
                                                to indemnify us for any liability or expenses arising from such

                                                greater than their face value, exchanged for cash (except where
                                                legally required), or returned for cash refunds (except where
                                                legally mandated). It&#8217;s important to note that the

                                                your Gift Card Balance against theft or unauthorized use. Once
                                                sold, the title to and risk of loss for Gift Cards pass to the
                                                purchaser. In the event of suspected unauthorized use or theft
                                                of your Gift Card Balance, please contact Herbs of Africa at

                                            <p>PRIVACY AND INTERNATIONAL USERS</p>
                                            <p>Your registration details and specific other information

                                                the United States. Herbs of Africa does not assert that the

                                                from alternate countries do so voluntarily and are accountable
                                                for adherence to local laws.</p>
                                            <p>The subsequent provision pertains solely to individuals who are
                                                consumers in the United Kingdom: A third party who is not a
                                                party to this Agreement does not possess any entitlement under
                                                the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any
                                                provision contained within this Agreement. However, this
                                                provision does not undermine any rights or remedies available to
                                                such a third party, which are separate from those offered by the
                                                aforementioned Act.</p>

                                            <p>Interactions between you and Herbs of Africa may occur through
                                                electronic means, whether via visiting the Services, sending
                                                e-mails, receiving notices on the Services, or communicating
                                                through e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to
                                                receive electronic communications from Herbs of Africa, and (b)
                                                acknowledge that all terms, conditions, agreements, notices,
                                                disclosures, and other communications provided by Herbs of
                                                Africa electronically fulfill any legal requirements that such
                                                communications would satisfy if they were in writing. This
                                                provision does not impact your statutory rights.</p>
                                            <p>Your use of the Site is governed by the laws of the state of
                                                Texas, U.S.A., without consideration of choice of law
                                                provisions.</p>
                                            <p>If local law dictates that consumer contracts must be interpreted
                                                under local law and enforced in the jurisdiction&#8217;s courts,
                                                this section may not apply (but only to the extent of conflict
                                                with local law). This Agreement, along with your rights and
                                                obligations, cannot be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or
                                                transferred by you without our prior written consent; any
                                                attempted action in violation of this requirement will be null
                                                and void. Herbs of Africa holds the right to assign any part or
                                                all of the Agreement without restrictions.</p>
                                            <p>We are not responsible for any delay or failure to perform due to
                                                causes beyond our reasonable control, such as acts of nature,
                                                war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, actions by civil or military
                                                authorities, fires, floods, accidents, strikes, shortages, or
                                                transportation or shipping delays. One-time waiver or
                                                non-enforcement of any provision of this Agreement does not
                                                equate to waiving any other provision or the same provision on
                                                subsequent occasions. If any part of this Agreement is deemed
                                                invalid or unenforceable, it will be interpreted to reflect the
                                                original intent of the parties as closely as possible, while the
                                                remaining portions will remain valid and effective.</p>
                                            <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement
                                                between the parties, superseding all prior communications,
                                                representations, or agreements, whether oral or written, on the
