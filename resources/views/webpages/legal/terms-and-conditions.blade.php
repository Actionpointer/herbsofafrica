                        <h2>Links/graphics on your site, in your emails, or other communications</h2>

                            your site and the <strong>Herbs of Africa®</strong> properly utilizes such special
                            link formats. Links to the <strong>Herbs of Africa®</strong> placed on your site
                            pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are
                            referred to as &#8220;Special Links.&#8221; You will earn referral fees only with

                        <p>Affiliate links should point to the page of the product being promoted.</p>
                        <h2>Referral fees/commissions and payment</h2>
                        <p>For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must
                            click-through a Special Link from your site, email, or other communications to
                            <strong>http://herbsofafrica.com</strong> and complete an order for a product during
                            that session.</p>
                        <p>We will only pay commissions on links that are automatically tracked and reported by
                            our systems. We will not pay commissions if someone says they purchased or someone
                            says they entered a referral code if it was not tracked by our system. We can only
                            pay commissions on business generated through properly formatted special links that
                            were automatically tracked by our systems.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to disqualify commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or
                            overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.</p>
                        <p>Payments only begin once you&#8217;ve earned more than <strong>$20</strong> in
                            affiliate income. If your affiliate account never crosses the <strong>$20</strong>
                            threshold, your commissions will not be realized or paid. We are only responsible
                            for paying accounts that have crossed the <strong>$20</strong> threshold.</p>
                        <h2>Identifying yourself as a Herbs of Africa® Affiliate</h2>
                        <p>You may not issue any press release with respect to this Agreement or your
                            participation in the Program; such action may result in your termination from the
                            Program. In addition, you may not in any manner misrepresent or embellish the
                            relationship between us and you, say you develop our products, say you are part of
                            <strong>Herbs of Africa®</strong> or express or imply any relationship or
                            affiliation between us and you or any other person or entity except as expressly
                            permitted by this Agreement (including by expressing or implying that we support,
                            sponsor, endorse, or contribute money to any charity or other cause).</p>
                        <p>You may not purchase products through your affiliate links for your own use. Such
                            purchases may result (in our sole discretion) in the withholding of referral fees
                            and/or the termination of this Agreement.</p>
                        <h2>Payment schedule</h2>
                        <p>As long as your current affiliate earning are over <strong>$20</strong>, you&#8217;ll
                            be paid each month. If you haven&#8217;t earned <strong>$20</strong> since your last
                            payment, we&#8217;ll pay you the following month after you&#8217;ve crossed the
                            threshold.</p>
                        <h2>Customer definition</h2>
                        <p>Customers who buy products through this Program will be deemed to be our customers.
                            Accordingly, all of our rules, policies, and operating procedures concerning

                            We may change our policies and operating procedures at any time. For example, we

                            your site, you should not display product prices on your site. We will use
                            commercially reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot
                            guarantee the availability or price of any particular product.</p>

                            jurisdiction. Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted under the rules

                            under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party
